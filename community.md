## 1) Introduction

Monero is secure, untraceable, electronic cash. It is open-source, decentralized, and freely accessible to all. In this video, we will touch on some key aspects of Monero and community dynamics.

## 2) Technology recap

In the previous videos we talked about how Monero works from a technological perspective.
We saw how ring signatures obscures the source of a transaction, stealth addresses hides the recipient's wallet address, RingCT masks the amount sent, and how Kovri cloaks IP addresses.
Now, we will turn to how Monero is different from other cryptocurrencies.

## 3) How is Monero different?

For one, Monero is a fairly distributed cryptocurrency.
There was no premine/instamine, developer tax, nor presale of tokens in an initial coin offering.
Monero is based on a steady emission curve and uses a Proof of Work protocol that is configured in such a way that ordinary users can easily mine on consumer-grade equipment.
This feature ensures decentralization by de-incentivising the development of application-specific hardware.
Such industrial equipment leads to the concentration of hashing power to a few miners, which could potentially enable bad actors to act against the interest and values of the community.

As an open source project, everyone is free to review, copy, remix, or propose modifications to the code.
Development decisions are transparent and meeting chat logs are publicly accessible online for the world to see.
You do not have to trust a for-profit corporation, vulnerable to secret court orders, or an omniscient, mythical founder.

The Monero Project is a grassroots initiative that is made up a loose collective of individuals that are passionate about writing high quality, secure code.
There is no company, shareholders, nor central authority that dictates the development process.
Community members voluntarily associate with each other for the mutual interest of advancing the right to transactional privacy.

## 4) Hangouts

Many users are active on the Monero subreddit, which has seen steady, organic growth in the number of subscribers over the years.
There are also related, subject-specific subreddits, such as “xmrtrader” – for price speculation, “MoneroMining” – for mining questions, “MoneroMarket” –  a place to buy or sell items with Monero, “MoneroCommunity” – a spot to discuss outreach, and “Kovri” – a subreddit dedicated for the Kovri project.
Besides Reddit, members of the community are active in the #monero channel on Freenode IRC, Mattermost, and Slack.
If you are an avid Twitter user, you can follow announcements and current developments on the official Monero account at “monerocurrency”.
There is also an open-source project management system that is available on taiga.getmonero.org, where community members can meet, plan, and work on exciting new projects.
Many of the projects currently being worked on in taiga were crowdfunded by the community through the Forum Funding System.

## 5) Forum Funding System (FFS)

The Forum Funding System (also known as "FFS") is an avenue available to individuals or companies that would like to propose an idea and seek funding from the Monero community.
Once the idea has enough positive feedback momentum, the proposal is elevated to a "Funding Required" status and opened for direct donations.
Funds are placed in escrow and under the watchful eye of one of the members of the core team.
If the crowdfunding round is successful, the proposal is moved to a "Work in Progress" category, where the contractor is able to start working on the project.
Funds are release according to a specified milestone schedule.
In the event the contractor abandons the project, anyone can pickup the project to complete any outstanding tasks.
If a project has not been active or a proposal failed to reach the funding target after for some time, the funds may be re-appropriated at the discretion of the core team.
Some projects funded using FFS method include, the design on an open source hardware wallet, the employment of a mathematician and computational physicist, and interestingly, this very video you are currently watching.
The FFS encourages innovation and development of projects beneficial to the Monero ecosystem.

## 6) Conclusion

As it has been shown, Monero is a revolutionary cryptocurrency, like no other, that is private by default and cryptographically secure.
There is a vibrant community committed to decentralization and the development of high quality open software, without the need to trust anyone.
With Monero, you are indeed your own bank!
