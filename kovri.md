## 1) - Intro

Monero is secure, untraceable, electronic cash. It is open-source, decentralized, and freely accessible to all. In this video, we will focus on an anonymity technology, called Kovri.

## 2) - Technology recap

Up to now, we have covered how Monero obfuscates information stored on the blockchain.
Ring signatures obscure the sender.
Stealth addresses prevent outside observers from knowing the receiving address.
And RingCT hides the amount of Monero that's transmitted.
However, some personally identifiable information may be leaked at the network level when making a transaction.
This privacy leak is addressed with technology called Kovri.

## 3) - The Term - Kovri

Kovri is a free, decentralized, anonymity technology based on I2P's open specifications.
Kovri uses both encryption and sophisticated routing techniques to create a private overlay-network across the Internet.
This protected overlay allows users to hide their geographical location and IP address, essentially making Internet traffic anonymous.
An IP address is like a home address for the Internet, so this is quite sensitive information, to say the least.


## 4) Examples

Let's go through a few scenarios to see how this lightweight, security-focused software helps strengthen the unique privacy properties of Monero.

Suppose Alice wants to send Monero to Bob.
Alice's wallet creates a transaction, which then asks her daemon (her node) to broadcast it to the Monero network.
Alice's node is connected to several nodes run by network peers, so those peers are first to receive a broadcast of her transaction.
Those peers have peers of their own, to which they rebroadcast Alice's transaction.
This process repeats until most - or all - nodes on the Monero network have Alice's transaction.

In order for this relaying of transactions to occur, nodes must be able to communicate with one another.
Nodes communicate by directing messages to the intended recipients using the recipient's IP address.
Nearly all communications between computers are accomplished the same way.
This means that it is possible to geographically trace data as it travels the internet, from start to finish and everywhere in between.

Back to Alice, we now see that she is taking a risk by broadcasting her transaction.
Some nodes may be logging IP addresses when transactions are received.
Every one of Alice's node's network peers knows her IP address; therefore, each one of those peers has the ability to keep track of when a new transaction was first broadcast to them by Alice's node.

Since Monero nodes tend to connect to only a limited number of peers, a transaction broadcast by Alice's node is not a conclusive indicator that Alice has initiated a transaction.
And, even though the sender's and recipient's wallet addresses - as well as the amount of Monero sent - remain private, an adversary with enough resources could attempt to associate transactions with IP addresses to determine from where transactions originate.
This could potentially lead to an adversary not relaying her transactions to the rest of the network; or - worse - arriving at her front door.

What can Alice do to mitigate these threats? 
She can use Kovri!
If Alice uses Kovri to broadcast her transactions, no one will know the source of her transactions.
Additionally, if she connects to the Monero network exclusively over Kovri, her peers will no longer see her IP address, making passive surveillance tactics impractical.

Now letâ€™s imagine a different scenario.
Suppose Charlie wants to support the Monero network by running a full node at his home.
After a few weeks, he receives a cease and desist letter from his Internet Service Provider informing him that running a node is a violation of the terms of service.
Charlie could have avoided this situation in the first place by anonymizing his Internet traffic with Kovri.
Kovri substantially improves Monero's censorship resistance by making it even more difficult to detect and shut down nodes.

In our last scenario, suppose Dave is an operator of a mining pool that donates a portion of block rewards to a political party or controversial cause.
Other nodes could purposefully reject his solved blocks to express their disagreement with his political views.
However, if Dave can send his solved blocks through Kovri, then no one can censor the new blocks created by his pool, since the source of solved blocks are unknown.

As you can see, Kovri is a software that allows users to send transactions more privately and anonymously than ever before.
Let's next go over some fairly technical stuff to have a better understanding of how Kovri works under the hood.

## 5) Kovri and Technical Attributes

Kovri is currently built from I2P's open standards. I2P stands for the invisible internet project. Kovri is as an anonymizing router which tunnels traffic through the I2P network.

To protect their anonymity, each participant connects to other network members and uses them to pass messages.
In most circumstances, people will choose several peers for incoming and outgoing connections.
People can use more peers for greater privacy at the cost of performance.

Suppose Dave's mining pool has just solved a block and would like to send this transaction information to the other network members.
Dave's router will send the message to his two outgoing peers, who will then search for the incoming peers of other nodes on the network.
Dave can commincate securely without other Monero nodes on the network knowing what his actual IP address is.
The other participants in the I2P network do not know what their place is in the chain of routing, nor do they know what information is being relayed inside the network.
This is called garlic routing, wherein the only information shown to peers is the instruction set for sending to the next peer.

Currently based on the Invisible Internet Project's open specifications, Kovri uses both garlic encryption and garlic routing to create a private, protected overlay-network across the internet.
This overlay-network provides Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave with the ability to effectively hide their geographical location and internet IP address from each other.
Essentially, Kovri *covers* an application's internet traffic to make it anonymous within the network.

TODO: to harsh a segue?

Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave all have at least one thing in common: their IP addresses are exposed to each other.
This means they all have the ability to log the geographical locations of every peer they connect to.
Their only choice is to hide their IP address from each other.

There are several ways for them to hide their IP addresses.
They could use Tor, or they could use a trusted VPN; but both of these strategies have weaknesses.

The Tor network has "semi-trusted" Directory Authorities which give a handful of Tor node operators overreaching influence into network consensus.
Network consensus ultimately determines who is allowed to relay traffic on the Tor network based on the views of the Authorities.
A design flaw that has yet to be fixed, Tor's Directory Authorities negatively affect decentralization and thus negatively affect decentralized applications.

Another option of using a trusted VPN brings up the issue of trivial bandwidth correlation; making it easy for 3-letter agencies to de-anonymize a user's traffic.
VPNs also adhere to local laws in order to stay in business; so Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave would always run the risk of having their user data given to a government whose policies they doesn't agree with.
Most importantly, Trusted VPNs don't protect Bob from Alice knowing who Bob is, or Dave from Charlie, and so on. This means that no-one is truly hidden from one another when using a VPN.


## 6) - Conclusion

Kovri will revolutionize peer-to-peer connections and increase network resiliency and privacy worldwide.
Malicious nodes can no longer threaten users who create transactions or block them from propagating across the network.
It will come bundled with future Monero releases and be enabled by default.
Kovri will also feature a common API that would allow other cryptocurrencies and applications to use it, not just Monero.
